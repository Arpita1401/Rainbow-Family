## Inspiration
As per detailed research and studies, people coming out as non-binary go through a lot of difficulties, especially in the earlier days, leading to an identity crisis, mental breakdown, depression, and sometimes even attempt to suicide. So, to overcome the unfortunate situation, we believe family is the safest place to go to. It is extremely important for an LBGTQ person to have families who respond to their identity, get reactions that can positively contribute to their health, mental health, and overall development. But unfortunately, there are very few comprehensive studies of how parental, caregiver, and family reactions contribute to their lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBTQ) children’s risk and well-being. So, we have come up with - The rainbow family which helps the family track down their child’s emotions, helps them support in emotional situations, and overall be there for them. It is a technology to enhance the Significance of Parenting and Parent-Child Relationships for Sexual and Gender Minority Adolescents

## What it does
1. Families can register themselves through the web app and can, learn how to support their child and the non-binary child can register in the app to get the support they need.

2. They can have access to the various questions that they have in their mind and get proper researched results which will constantly be updated and new queries will be added

3. At the end of every month, the family and child will be asked to fill a bunch of questions which will then be assessed partly by our website design and partly by a gay administrator associated with the organization which will help the whole family to see how far they’ve come.

4. We also are planning to add a mental health meter, wherein every day, every child can add in how he is feeling, which will then be rated as angry, sad, happy, breakdown, etc. .This will also be visible to the family, but as an addition, they will be given suggestions to act upon in that situation. 

5. Families can even send their queries through the contact us form which will directly be sent to counselors and they will get solutions to their needs and proper guidance on the way.

## Challenges we ran into
We are constantly working hard to make our website better and make it as interactive as possible. We were a bit challenged by one of our features of adding authentication with phone numbers, but eventually, we got through it. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very happy with the fact that we could build something for a community that needs to get more acknowledgment in society and just stand with them. 
## What's next for Rainbow.Family
At this moment, we have just our website for teens or youth, but we plan to make it accessible to adults and even kids who are discovering their identity as well.
